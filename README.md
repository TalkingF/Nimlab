# Nimlab
An implementation of the game Nim using MATLAB.

Nim is a two-player game where the objective is to not be the last person picking up an object from a stack. The game is mathematically solved, like Connect Four and Tic-tac-toe. As a result, Nimlab allows you to compete against several difficulties of programmed solutions and board sizes. The simulated player will calculate the Nim Sum at the end of each turn allowing it to select the optimal move if the difficulty dictates. 

NimLab was a project developed early in 2023 which was moved to a new repository.
